## Hi! I'm Alex üëã

I'm a passionate full-stack software engineer with a unique background in program management and real estate. My journey into software development began with an intensive six-month bootcamp at App Academy, where I honed my skills in building modern, user-focused web applications.

Today, I thrive on creating innovative solutions to complex problems, combining technical expertise with a knack for collaboration and adaptability. With hands-on experience in JavaScript, Python, React, Redux Toolkit, Flask, and SQL, I‚Äôve successfully built scalable, high-performance applications from scratch. Whether it‚Äôs developing responsive frontends, designing efficient backend APIs, or optimizing user experiences, I enjoy every step of the process.

Before transitioning to tech, I spent years managing teams and delivering results in high-pressure environments. As a Program Manager at Google with EXOS, I led a team of over 50 employees, achieving significant growth and honing my leadership and analytical skills. My career in real estate further sharpened my client-focused approach and ability to navigate complex systems‚Äîskills that now complement my engineering work.

I‚Äôm driven by curiosity and a love of learning, constantly pushing myself to master new tools and technologies. When I‚Äôm not coding, you‚Äôll find me exploring the outdoors, spending time with my family, or brainstorming the next big project.

Feel free to check out my portfolio, connect with me on LinkedIn, or reach out‚ÄîI‚Äôd love to chat about opportunities to build impactful software solutions together!
